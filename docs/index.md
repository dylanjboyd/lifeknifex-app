# LifeKnifeX
Welcome to LifeKnifeX. By now you probably know that the purpose of this tool has something to do with emulating a swiss army knife, but what is it other than that?

In short let's say you want to...

- eat and drink better
- get to sleep on time
- feel positive about every day
- understand trends in your mood
- have fun organising your life
- improve your career perspective and performance

...just to name a few. That's what LifeKnifeX is for! A tool to improve organisation and reduce chaos in your life. It does this by applying specific principles to the user interface, interaction models, and language used throughout the platform. [Learn more](principles.md) about these principles.

To learn more about the features and offerings in the platform, [read about its sections here](sections/index.md).
