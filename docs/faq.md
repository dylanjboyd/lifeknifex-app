# FAQs
This is where I answer all questions that I can think of relating to the general LifeKnifeX platform. If you have a question not listed here, you might find it in a section-specific FAQ, instead.

## Why the name?
Whenever I name one of my projects (and sadly many never see the light of day), I try to make it creative, but keep it as relevant to the core purpose of the project.

This project started out as *Stringnt*, being that my hope was for the tool to make me more stringent (see what I did there...) when going about my day-to-day activities. 

Upon explaining the basic concept and purpose of the platform to a friend, I mentioned to them that it was synonymous to a swiss army knife - lots of useful things all bundled into one neat package.

It was then that they suggested Life Knife. I absolutely loved the name and rushed to change every single line of code that used the (now) old "Stringnt" to "LifeKnife".

After a moment of pause, I realised that I should probably have checked the domain name availability before running to create more work for myself. As with many good things, it was unavailable.

I'd love to tell you that the "X" appeared as a result of the "X" shaped scar I have from slashing through bushes in the Amazon rainforest while running from a jaguar, but I'm about to disappoint you.

That same friend then suggested putting an "X" at the end of the name. I know - that seems really stereotypical and perhaps even a cop-out, but it looked good!

Right. That's the most embarrassing bit out of the way.
