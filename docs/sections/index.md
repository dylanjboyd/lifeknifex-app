# Sections

LifeKnifeX has lots of organisational features to offer. To ensure that you understand and use these features as proficiently as possible, they are distributed across distinct, separate areas of the site called *Sections*.

If you have general questions about sections, [see the FAQ](faq.md). They may have been answered for you!

## [Nutrition](nutrition/index.md)
Logging what you eat and drink is the first step to becoming healthier, little by little.

## [Goals](goals/index.md)
If you have an aspiration to achieve something big in life, start here. Every bit counts.

## [Career](career/index.md)
If you don't track how well you're doing in your job, how will you see improvement? Start here.

## [Mood](mood/index.md)
If there's one thing that counts more than emotions, it's your mood. Don't let it run you over.
